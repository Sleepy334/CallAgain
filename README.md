# CallAgain
A mod for Cities Skylines
I'm sick and no ambulances are coming, why don't you call them again dear.

If you find you always have sick or dead people in your city and no one comes to pick them up or your commercial buildings keep being abandoned due to no goods available then this mod will help.

Features
Call Again will detect when a building has sick or dead people inside and no vehicles are responding and will add a new high priority transfer offer to hopefully get a response.

Call Again checks whether vehicles are already responding or a Transfer Offer is already in the system before adding a new one to ensure no double call outs occur.

The threshold when call again activates and the frequency of requests can be controlled in the settings.

Currently supports the following issues:
Sick
Dead
Goods (Incoming)
Garbage
Crime - Airport main building only.
Cargo Stations
Also has an option to monitor cargo stations and automatically de-spawn returning cargo trucks. This can help dramatically if your cargo stations always have a long line of cargo trucks waiting to be slowly processed.
